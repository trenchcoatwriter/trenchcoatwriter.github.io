							<h2><em>Wilderness</em></h2>
							<p>Nine years after the Great War, Don Whitfield finds himself in another fight for survival, this time in the rugged mountains of his native Georgia. 
								Prohibition may have outlawed traditional moonshining, but for Don and his friends, it remains an important means of providing for their families 
								within a dwindling economy. Despite the new dangers, they persist, brewing and selling their wares to a group of northern middlemen who distribute 
								the liquor further north. This changes when their latest bootlegging exchange is disrupted by a group of well-armed revenuers who then pursue them 
								across the mountains in a dangerous cat-and-mouse chase.</p>
							<p>Now thrust together, the two disparate groups of renegades must work with each other to evade the feds and reach their homes alive and undiscovered 
								before the harsh winter threatens to end them outright. Their journey crosses more than rough terrain, as the men contemplate the nature of humanity 
								and the scars of war and trauma. For Don, the memories of the no man’s land force him to reexamine his own ideals and the legacy he’ll leave his son. 
								As their ordeal intensifies, Don’s resolve and skills are tested. He knows the route home will be as perilous as the trenches in the war. Especially 
								with a traitor embedded within the group.</p>

							<h2><em>The Truth in the LInES</em></h2>
							<h4>Jonathan Blythe Mythfinder Series</h4>
							<h4>Part of The Calazar Universe©</h4>				     
							<p><em>“What is worse, a total lie, a half-truth, or a bitter fact?” Jon asked. “That’s the thing about mythology, no matter the race or species. In myth, 
								a single story can contain them all.”</em></p>

							<p>At the crossroads of myth and fact, Jonathan Blythe has always had a keen mind for details and an obsession for pursuing answers. But as he is warned 
								upon returning to Calazar from Earth, those who hunt for answers may yet become prey themselves.</p>

							<p>In an alternative future, where magic and advanced science coexist alongside a humanity that is one species among millions - both familiar and new - 
								there are still mysteries to be uncovered. Still truth buried behind lost histories, under the lines of sagas and ancient texts, and within the 
								whispers of legends passed along the ages. And some of them are especially dangerous.</p>

							<p>When Jon is approached to investigate a series of lost documents pertaining to an ancient kingship feud among the Lycanni race, he swiftly realizes 
								there was more to the story of rival heirs than first glanced. As Jon becomes embroiled in his search, he discovers connections to ancient Earth, 
								conspiracy, and a looming threat both to himself and others.</p>

							<p>The more Jon uncovers, the more he contends with a forgotten Lycanni sect, as deadly as any shadow force. On ancient Earth, Lycanni were also called 
								Lycanthropes - Werewolves.</p>

							<p><em>"He heard the voice loudest of all, a forceful presence that drilled into his mind with the precision of a burrowing ant. It overpowered 
								everything. The pounding rain, the screech of metal, the boom of mortars, the cries of war and death. There was only this voice that 
								reverberated against his consciousness with a strength beyond ages, laced with a sting of malice, or of indifference. Then, he saw it. A 
								shadow in the rain..."</em></p>

							<p>On the world of Zeris, Kilian Falstaff leads his mercenary team on what they hope will be a final blow against a treacherous rebel threatening 
								their patron kingdom. Upon infiltrating their enemy’s stronghold though, Kilian uncovers a darker scheme to their enemy’s designs. For this is 
								no mere captured city, but where Vormir Stonehand intends to call down the most potent of magic upon them and all the world.</p>

							<p>Facing dire odds, Kilian encounters an entity older than the most ancient of gods and is offered power to save his friends and overcome the threat. 
								The price is his eternal soul.</p>

							<p>Now blessed and cursed with this magic, Kilian strives to understand the extent of his bargain and uncover the proprietor of his deal, all while 
								navigating a world that fears the very mention of his kind: Warlock.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>About the Author</h2>
							<p>Eric Campos, the Trenchcoat Writer - so named because he wears a trenchcoat and is a writer (how original) - is a lifelong storyteller. 
								I remember early on when my mom would buy me these blank, glossy booklets from a long-closed retail store of awesomeness to scribble down ideas 
								and draw stories in ... I’d always fill the pages. Even back then, I had stories in my head. This would crystalize in middle school, when a simple 
								project changed everything: create a fantasy world. This spark of inspiration would be the catalyst leading me to eventually create the world of 
								Calazar©, where most of my stories take place. But that was just the start of my very long journey that still continues.</p>

							<p>I grew up learning and reading from a range of brilliant writers. Some of my favorites include J. R. R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, Robert E. Howard, 
								Andre Norton, Erich Maria Remarque, K. V. Johansen, Mary Shelley, Jim Butcher, Jack London, and William Shakespeare, to name a few. All this time, 
								my fascination with mythology has propelled my research and contemplation of inherent human themes expressed and explored through storytelling.</p>

							<p>When it comes to writing, I love deep, unique characters. Anti-heroes are fine, but I find myself most drawn to realistic characters who have integrity 
								and struggle with relatable things that, despite fictional or fantastical elements and circumstances, are ultimately overcome because of their own 
								merits and steadfast dedication to their individual codes. I firmly believe deus ex machinas are a sign of lazy writing, and I seek to avoid 
								political agendas. When my characters face issues that may mirror those in our world, I take a middle ground. Two sides locked in dispute can be 
								both right and wrong in some measure.</p>

							<p>My next focus is on prose. I don’t want to just tell unique stories and bring intriguing characters to life, I want the writing to flow in a way 
								that’s, well, beautiful. I think that prose and the way stories are written are as essential to the narrative as the plot itself. As a marketer, 
								it’s not just what you say, but how you say it that matters. It’s why John Milton’s Satan in <em>Paradise Lost</em> is so intriguing, even tragic. 
								His words shaped the story in a way that, in addition to seamlessly carrying the narrative, made each character unique - like a distinct thread 
								within a spider’s web. It’s why Hemingway’s curt writing style is so iconic and yet mesmerizing when he delves into longer passages that speak 
								directly to the elements of the world and our struggles within it. So, if there was a scale between storyteller and writer, I’d place myself on 
								the writer side. I might not be able to spin a yarn on the spot, but give me a sheet of paper (and a pen), and I’ll make it sing.</p>

							<p>In the really real world, I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-campos-875b0545">a professional wordsmith, editor, and content marketer</a> 
								with over 9 years of experience and content produced/published in multiple industries (SaaS, B2B, and B2C, to name a few). I graduated from 
								Loyola University Maryland with a degree in English. I’m a lifelong martial artist whose answer to whether the pen is mightier than the sword 
								is: both. I am married to a beautiful, brilliant scientist who inspires and uplifts me every day: my fairytale woman. When we’re not hiking, 
								we’re likely at home watching movies, playing board games, and otherwise taking care of our spoiled guinea pigs.</p>

							<p>If you’re reading this, you’re witnessing my first major steps toward sharing/publishing some of my completed works with the world. Publishing’s a 
								tough game - there’s a lot of competition, but I’m going to go for it. I’m no stranger to struggle. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for 
								reading, thank you for letting me share this part of myself with you. I’m not used to expositing about myself, so I hope I didn’t come off 
								pretentious or snobby - qualities I disdain. I hope that you enjoy the stories I bring forth, and that they delight, inspire, and empower you, 
								while also providing a chance to escape from the typical chaos and humdrum we all face in life.</p>
